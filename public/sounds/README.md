# Sound Effects Setup

This folder contains placeholder sound files for the interactive feedback system. To enable audio feedback, replace these placeholder files with actual audio files:

## Required Sound Files:

- **analysis-start.mp3** - Plays when "Analizar mi texto" is clicked
- **achievement.mp3** - Plays when completing challenges or earning achievements
- **challenge-start.mp3** - Plays when "Continuar reto" is clicked
- **save-draft.mp3** - Plays when saving drafts (currently working)
- **planning-complete.mp3** - Plays when completing planning tasks
- **connector-insert.mp3** - Plays when inserting connectors

## Recommended Audio Characteristics:

- **Duration**: 0.2-1.5 seconds
- **Volume**: Warm, medium tones (not too high or low pitched)
- **Format**: MP3 for universal compatibility
- **Style**: Subtle, satisfying, non-intrusive

## Where to Find Sounds:

1. **Freesound.org** - Free sound effects library
2. **Zapsplat.com** - Professional sound effects (registration required)
3. **UI Sound** packs from various sources
4. Create custom sounds with audio editing software

## Tips:

- Test sounds at low volume first
- Ensure sounds complement the user experience
- Consider creating a subtle "whoosh" + "ding" combination for analysis
- Use gentle "pop" or "click" sounds for interactions
- Achievement sounds should be celebratory but not overwhelming

The sound system will gracefully handle missing files, so the app will work even without actual audio files.
